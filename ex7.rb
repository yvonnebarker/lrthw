# Print the string
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
# Print the string
puts "It's fleece was white as #{'snow'}"
# Print the string
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
# Print '.' ten times
puts "." * 10 # what did that do?

# Create a variable end1 set to C
end1 = "C"
# Create a variable end2 set to h
end2 = "h"
# Create a variable end3 set to e
end3 = "e"
# Create a variable end4 set to e
end4 = "e"
# Create a variable end5 set to s
end5 = "s"
# Create a variable end6 set to e
end6 = "e"
# Create a variable end7 set to B
end7 = "B"
# Create a variable end8 set to u
end8 = "u"
# Create a variable end9 set to r
end9 = "r"
# Create a variable end10 set to g
end10 = "g"
# Create a variable end11 set to e
end11 = "e"
# Create a variable end12 set to r
end12 = "r"

# Joins together and prints variables end 1 to end 6 without a new line (Line break) at the end
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
# Joins together and prints variables end 7 to end 12 with a new line at the end
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 +end11 + end12
